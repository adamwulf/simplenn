# Simple Neural Network
This repo is based on the the blog post [A Step by Step Backpropagation Example](http://mattmazur.com/2015/03/17/a-step-by-step-backpropagation-example/) by [@mhmazur](https://twitter.com/mhmazur).

## Goal

The goal of this repository is not to provide an efficient neural network framework. Instead, the goal is to provide the very bare bones necessary to show the concepts used in neural networking.

The code is setup so that it is easy to build very small and primitive networks, and slowly step through them to better understand how the values pass through the network to the final output

## Tutorial Code

The code for the completed step-by-step walkthrough is available at the tag `finished-tutorial`. After that tag, I continued learning by extending the code to:

1. Adjust the weight of the bias neurons
2. Other stuff!


## More Information

As I learn more about neural networking, I am collecting sites and papers into an [Evernote Notebook](https://www.evernote.com/pub/adamwulf/aiandmachinelearning). Maybe you'll find this notebook useful for your learning as well.

Thanks!
